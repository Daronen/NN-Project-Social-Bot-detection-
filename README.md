<h1 align="center">Social Bot Detection Project</h1>

Crucial problem with Twitter is automated users (bots).
They can start trends and spread misinformation.
Many bot farms are made to push politician agendas (Russia).
Bots continue to improve over time making previous bot detection models useless.


Detecting these bots are crucial.
Companies like the FBI and other government agencies work to uncover these bot farms.
Our goal is to use a previous twitter bot detection models and apply domain adaptation to the model to get better results.
We then will compare the recorded results with previous testing accuracies.
